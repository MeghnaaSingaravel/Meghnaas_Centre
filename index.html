<h2>Hey guys...</h2> 

 

<h2>Meghnaa here... </h2>

  <h2>I have been wanting to start a blog for a long time, this Pro-Grad competition has paved the way. Till now I have seen 11 New Years, some new year celebrations were filled with more joy than the others.</h2> 

    <h2>2018 was one such great new year. I had baked some sweets to enjoy with friends n family but I fell asleep at 11:58p.m. I missed the main celebrations. </h2>

      <h2>So I have been practicing for the past 2 days to stay awake till 12 for this year’s  party. This year we have planned a all night camp-out at the beach for the new year. I hope it will be a adventurous new year party. Today is Mon Dec 28TH, the day I am writing  my first blog and there are  3 more days for the new year.</h2>  

        <h2>Oh! I just wish time moved faster. I just hope to remember and write a new blog every day/week. </h2>
