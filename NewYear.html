<h2>Before we start celebrating the new year it is important to remind ourselves to stop n reflect on the year that has gone by. To remember both our triumphs and our missteps, our promises made and broken, the times we opened ourselves up to great adventures or closed ourself down for fear of getting hurt. Because that's what New Year's are all about, getting another chance. A chance to forgive, to do better, to do more, to give more ,to love more. To stop worring about "what if" and start embracing what will be. And when the new year starts lets remember, to be nice and kind to each other. May the spirit of new year fill your heart with serenity and peace. Wish you a happy happy New year
