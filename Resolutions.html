<h2><u>History Of Resolution</u></h2>
<h2>The ancient Babylonians are said to have been the first people to make New Year's resolutions, some 4,000 years ago.
 They were also the first to hold recorded celebrations in honor of the new year—though for them the year began not in January but in mid-March, when the crops were planted.
The Babylonians are said to have started the tradition during Akitu, a 12-day New Year celebration.
   This new date honoured Janus, a two-faced god who symbolically looked back into the previous year and forwards into the new year.</h2>

<h2> <u> What is A Resolution</u></h2>
  <h2> A New Year's resolution is a tradition, most common in the Western Hemisphere but also found in the Eastern Hemisphere, in which a person resolves to continue good practices, change an undesired trait or behavior, accomplish a personal goal, or otherwise improve their life at the start of a new year.
   ﻿﻿﻿ Some of the most common resolutions include losing weight, sticking to a healthier diet, exercising regularly, making better financial choices, quitting smoking, and spending more time with family. While many people feel that they don't necessarily achieve their resolution goals, there is some good news.
